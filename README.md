# KBT KPM Repository

This repository contains the KPM package source and standalone feed for:

- `bluetooth-keymap-toggle`: one-tap Bluetooth HID and key-mapping control.

Install Kindle HID Passthrough with Button Mapper before using this add-on. The
HID package may already have been installed manually, so KBT deliberately does
not ask KPM to resolve it as a package dependency.

## Install

Use the canonical `kindle-lab` KPM hub:

```sh
/var/local/kmc/bin/kpm add-repo "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kindle-lab/kpm-repo/main/manifest.json"
/var/local/kmc/bin/kpm update
/var/local/kmc/bin/kpm install bluetooth-keymap-toggle
```

After installation, the library contains `Bluetooth + Key Mapping`.

## Library icon

Since 1.0.8 the scriptlet carries its own library cover, so it no longer shows
up as a blank thumbnail.

- The cover is embedded in the scriptlet header as
  `# Icon: data:image/png;base64,...`, the same way Button Mapper does it.
  The Kindle reads this header and builds the thumbnail in
  `documents/Bluetooth_Keymap_Toggle.sh.sdr/icon.png`.
- Source image: `packages/bluetooth-keymap-toggle/icon/icon.png`
  (520x804 grayscale, 2x the 260x402 cover size Kindle generates for
  scriptlets, so it keeps the portrait book-cover ratio).
- Generator: `packages/bluetooth-keymap-toggle/icon/make_icon.py`
  (Pillow). To change the cover, edit the script, regenerate `icon.png`,
  re-embed it in the `# Icon:` line, bump the version and rebuild the package.

If the thumbnail does not refresh after an upgrade, unplug USB and restart the
Kindle.

## Standalone feed

The repository-local `manifest.json` remains available for development and
standalone validation, but the public installation entry point is
`kindle-lab/kpm-repo`.

## Remove

```text
;kpm uninstall bluetooth-keymap-toggle
```

The Bluetooth package stops the HID and key-mapping processes on uninstall.

`SHA256SUMS` contains the package checksum.
